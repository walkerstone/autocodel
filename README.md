# autocodel (Auto copy delete)

Store a history with characters deleted from within any application
using the `[del]`, `[backsapce]` keys, and maybe the `[cmd]` + `[x]` combo 
to a board for cycling though. User can paste previously deleted
entries in front of their current insert point by typing an
inverse undo command;

`[cmd/ctrl]`+`[shift]`+`[z]`

followed by

`[up]`, `[down]`

arrow key presses to view different entries.

Simply successive alt undo's should continue to paste out the next 
remaining removal. Some limitation to size may be thought about
though I think the relative weight of text only entries indexed
numerically is inconsequential in the relative scheme of things..

##Entry
- A line?
- A selected group of lines?
- A string of bckspc hits within x(variable) time
